h3m:

(all absolute addresses on an s-size wog map with a three-character name, unless otherwise indicated)

Byte index
On the left-the byte number. All done on A S o size map
three-character name (move). Wog map format, unless checked.

0000 to 0003-map version, depends on format-wog (33), AB (15), ROE (0e), sod (1C). It is also checked by the H3 map editor
0004-on some Maps indicates whether there are players on the map; on maps Wog with ERMS does not work
0005 to 0008-map side length/width
0009-whether the map has subways (01) or not (00) - note - if the map has subways, the bytes describing the terrain on the surface are followed by the second number describing the subways
000a to 000d - map name length (editor allows up to 30 characters)
000e-first character of map name
- attention-from now on we assume the name of the map with a length of 3 characters!-
0011 to 0014-map description length
- note-from now on, we assume that the map has a description of 0 characters!-
0015-map difficulty level easy (00); normal (01); hard (02); expert (03); impossible (04)
0016 - limit the level of the hero
0017-the beginning of the description of players; if a player can not play his description starts with two bytes zero; if a player can not play, or there are no heroes, then his description takes 15 bytes; if he has one hero, then 25 bytes, if more, then 5 bytes for each additional + possible names (more precisely this is described below) (homes of heroes do not enter the number of Heroes of the player)
-note - when a player does not appear on the map, some of the bytes describing him may take random values
008E to last byte of player descriptions (if there are none)
008f to win condition (FF - standard, 00 - character artifact, 01 - collect squad, 02 - get resource, 03 - expand city, 04 - build grail, 05 - defeat specific hero, 06 - capture city, 07 - defeat specific monster, 08 - offlag habitats, 09 - offlag mines, 0a - transport artifact); if custom, this is followed by additional bytes (see description below)
0090 to the losing condition (FF-standard, 00 - loss of a specific city, 01-loss of a specific hero, 02-time limit); if non-standard, then additional bytes follow (see description below)
0091 to the number of teams; if non-zero, then 8 additional bytes describing the team numbers of subsequent players (team numbers start with 0) / assume that there are no teams in the numbering/
0092 to 00a5-information about which characters are available for the game (20 bytes, for RoE 16)
00a6 to 00a9-four nulls (reserved under potential new heroes?, appear from AB)
00aa - the number of available heroes, then for each:
* 1-hero ID
* 1 - Hero Portrait number (FF is standard)
* 4 name length (0 - standard
* [] name
* 1-which players can buy this hero (bit field, 87654321)
*

00aa-it is not very clear what, grayface says that these are Disposed heroes, but he did not want to elaborate on this. On most regular maps there is null and there are no extra bytes, but on some they appear. Pathology postponed. They appear from sod.
00ab to 00c9-31 nulli
00ca to 00db-information about which artifacts are available (18 bytes, up to and including AB 17)
00dc to 00e4-information on which spells are available (from SoD inclusive)
00e5 to 00e8-information about which abilities of the characters are available (from SoD inclusive)
00e9 to 00ec - number of reverbs (maximum 30) (if different from zero, to additional bytes (description below) (bytes 00ea to 00ec always equal to zero-are they not rooted to something else (?) (probably not))
further 156 bytes corresponding to information about predefined heroes (all heroes are 156)
if for which hero the byte is true, additional flags appear, whether there is a specified custom information:
* experience
* secondary skills
* artifacts
* biography
* shoulder
* witchcraft
* first-class skills

If any of these flags is true, then the corresponding information appears behind it, the form is identical as in the case of the object (instance) of the hero

Then they follow:
- description of the terrain (see below) - 7 bytes per field
- def statements (see next) - 4 bytes for their number, and then for each (4+length_name+42) bytes
- descriptions of all objects on the map (see further) - 4 bytes for their quantity, then depends on the objects
- time events (see below)
- variables dependent on you don't know what, they're probably just for a mix-up


0189-the beginning of the fields of the terrain (as there are no rumors)
From then on, the descriptions of the next fields of the terrain go.
After the last field there are bytes specifying the number of Def statements.
eight bytes after it begins the name of the first Defa. Are these eight
bytes are the limit of the number of defs on the map??? CF. def names precedes (04 00 00 00)
defy things used on the map
def consists of name length + name + 42 bytes description

after the list of defs follows the list of objects
First is the number of objects (4 bytes) (including monsters)
the following objects
12 bytes for each object
1 byte-wsp. X
2 byte-wsp. y
3 byte-level - (00) ground, (01) underground
4 byte-object identifier (unless the number in the DEFA sequence that defines it (according to the order of defs from previous declarations))
5 - 12 ??

(FF) and 3 bytes empty-why here??

monsters and objects follow
Each monster is defined by 24 bytes (or 36?????)
objects typically occupy 10 bytes (like artifacts and resources)
1 byte-wsp. X
2 byte-wsp. y
3 byte-level - (00) ground, (01) underground
4 byte-object identifier (unless the number in the DEFA line that defines it)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comments on the terrain:
The area code is the descriptions of the following fields, in strips from left to right, and
then from top to bottom (first surface, then underground). Each field consists of 7 bytes.
1 byte-terrain type-dirt (00), desert (01), grassland (02), snow
(03), swamp (04), rough (05), subterranean (06), lava (07) water (08)
2 byte-terrain appearance - Image number in Def
3 byte - presence of river-water (01), ice (02), mud (03), lava
(04); none - (00)
4 byte-direction / appearance of the river-Image number in Def
(pion (09), (0a); level (0b), (0c); circle (01); intersection (04);
offshoot pion _ | _ (05); offshoot Level (07); none - (00);;; sometimes (00)
also when there is a river (why?)- scope DP )

5.6 bytes-roads (check later), most likely analogous to rivers

7 byte - whether the given byte is the coast and whether (and possibly how) it is necessary to reflect the bitmap with the field

the coast adds 40 to this bit field

map field change caused by this byte:
we look at the 2 least significant bits (we take the number modulo 4)
if we have 00 (As for example at 00 or 40), then we leave the graphics alone
if we have 01 (As, for example, at 01 or 41), then we reflect the image symmetrically with respect to the vertical axis:
|
|
-----------------
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
-----------------
|
/ <- the axis against which we reflect
|
if we have 02 (As for example at 02 or 42), then we reflect the image symmetric to the horizontal axis
if we have 03 (As, for example, at 03 or 43), then we rotate in any direction by 180 degrees
similarly encoded are the reflections of the bitmap with the river (the next two least significant bits) and the road (the next two)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comments on Def statements
{for starters, we actually have the number of defs in normal format}
The beginning of each segment with Def is 4 bytes specifying the length of the name, and then the name (with extension),
and then 42 bytes.

Here's a table of values.

Columns separated by tabs.
The ' / ' diagonals separate values in hexes from decimal values (I specify values in this and in this).
Decimal byte numbering.
The letters and comments to which I refer are at the end of the file.

Byte Monsters Objects
defa name length (4 bytes, normal)
defa name
1 - 6 blockmap (see below)
7 - 12 visitmap (see below) - specifies the places where you can visit the object (they are organized in the same way as the blobkmap, with the only difference that the places visited are marked with a bit one, and the places not visited with a bit zero)
13 - 14 bit Field (9 bits; 8 in the first byte, 1 in the second) specifying the terrain on which the object can be placed in the editor
15 - 16 bit Field (9 bits; 8 in the first byte, 1 in the second) specifying the terrain of the object in the editor menu
17 - 20 object type object type (List B)
21 - 24 subtype-List A subtype-list E | 0 //if there is no subtype, it is (00)
25 list in the editor on which the object is located (0-Earth, 1-cities, 2-Monsters, 3-heroes, 4-artifacts, 5 - Resources)
26 (0/1) whether the object is "concave" (such as a pond with jewels) - objects that have this flag set will always be displayed under those that do not have it. ; Additionally, I observed that the shadows of objects with this flag are not displayed (it may still be worth checking)
27-42 zeros alone, they don't seem to be responsible for anything, maybe the developers reserved them for unrealized features?

The first six bytes define the fields blocked by the building (the 'to visit' fields also count as blocking).
Each of these bytes defines a lane 8 (maybe only 7?) horizontal, adjacent fields. The upper bytes define the upper bands. If the object occupies less than 6 vertical fields, the upper ones remain unused (=marked as free = (ff)), the blockmap is in the lower ones.
To determine which fields in a given lane are blocked, write the value of the byte in the binary system, (if necessary) add insignificant zeros to 8 characters, reverse the order. The subsequent digits of the number obtained will determine which fields are blocked and which are not. 1 is a free field and 0 is a busy field.
For example, if the object occupies the shape ('X' is the occupied field, a'.'this is a free field):
Xx.
XXX
.XX
It will be encoded by bytes:
1. (FF) - > bin 11111111 - > (reverse) 11111111 ->........
2. (FF) - > bin 11111111 - > (reverse) 11111111 ->........
3. (FF) - > bin 11111111 - > (reverse) 11111111 ->........
4. (9f) - > bin 10011111 - > (reverse) 11111001 ->.....Xx.
5. (1f) - > bin 00011111 - > (reverse) 11111000 ->.....XXX
6. (3f) - > bin 00111111 - > (reverse) 11111100 ->......XX
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comments about the heroes:
the hero normally occupies 46 bytes (without changing the garrison, name, artifacts, etc.).)
0001 - position after the x-coordinate
0002 - y-coordinate position
0003-level (??)
0004-always 02 (?)
000d-number (?) ---------------------
000e-always 0D (?) / these bytes specify |
000f-always CB (? who's bahater?
0010-always 12 (?) --------------------- {used e.g. for missions}
0011 - player number (Player 1 - 0, 2 - 1, etc.)
0012-hero type (e.g. Solmyr)
0013-whether the name is standard (00) or custom (01); if 01; then additional bytes: length: maximum 12 (decimal), three zero bytes and name; {warning! changing the name changes the tag in a significant way (along with its length)}
0014 - whether the experience is nonzero; if so, four additional bytes - [0003] * 100^3 + [0002] * 100^2 + [0002] * 100 + [0000] = experience
0016-standard skills (00) or not (01)
if not, then 4 bytes for their quantity and further their descriptions
0017-Garrison; 00-standard, 01-custom -> 28 additional bytes, 4 bytes per position, one or two First per monster type, the last two per quantity - write quantity as in other cases of writing numbers
0018-formation: loose - 00, tight - 01
0019-whether artifacts are standard (00) or custom (01); if custom, this byte is followed by 40 additional bytes describing the artifacts
{the last two bytes are the number of artifacts in the bag; if nonzero, then two additional bytes for each artifact in the bag}
001A-patrol: FF-none, WPP. patrol radius
001b-hero's biography: 00-none, 01-is, [additional bytes!]: 4 bytes per length (format as experienced) + content
001c-shoulder (?)- FF-standard, 00 - opposite
001d-whether spells are standard (00) or custom (9 additional bytes immediately after this byte)
001e - 00 or 01; after 01 insert 4 additional bytes (the length of the hero's opsiu increases to 50 characters) denoting attack, defense, power and knowledge; 00 denotes standard basic skills
all zeros.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remarks about monsters
Typically, the monster takes 24 bytes
first four like each object (pos+def)
further 8 zeros
four bytes per type (probably per type, but doesn't fit anything else) {used e.g. on missions}
two bytes for the number of units under the open sky, 00 if it is random
one to determine the character, 00 - the most friendly, 04 - the most hostile
one to determine if there is a treasure / description
and if it is, then an additional four bytes per message length, a little per message content, 7 by 4 for the amount of raw materials and two for the artifact
one to determine if the unit never runs away (01) or is normal (00)
one to determine whether the number of units increases with time (00) or not (01) and in the dark to bind
two always zero
[PS: when does a monster take 36 bytes???]
